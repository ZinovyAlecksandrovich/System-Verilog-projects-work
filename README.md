SV projects:

ECE 385 FINAL: "Arcade 8-bit Boss Gauntlet game" uses Quartus Platform, directly programed onto Intel MAX-10 FPGA. 



Test0 : Uses CMOS embeded camera to track any object defined by user. Capable of reporting the acceleration data of object as well as full 360 degree rotation and varaible velocity. Implements both I2C and SPI protocols t ocommunicate with the camera, accelerator and motor. Used Opal Kelly API on python to send and recieve data from sensors. Used Vivado to implement protocols on the XEM7310-A75 FPGA
